    <h1>My cause: Long Term Happiness</h1>
    <div class="point">
    <h2>Why is that my cause?</h2>
    <p>We all know happiness is good. I've made the distinction between long term happiness, which I would call <b>fulfillment</b>, and short term happiness, which I would call <b>pleasure</b>. Short term happiness is fleeting. It's good for maybe a couple minutes (in the case of, say, a really good cookie), or maybe a whole day (like a birthday party). But you can't ride on the high of short term happiness all the time. True happiness is long term, and it is achieved by a satisfaction with one's character, situation, and accomplishments. <i>That</i> is what makes life beautiful.</p>

    <h2>Data Point 1: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2017.csv">Happiness by Country</a></h2>
    <p>The csv on this website tells us average self-reported happiness, on a scale of 1-10, per country. Upon quick glance, the data doesn't seem to tell me much, other than perhaps that living in Norway is preferable to living in Syria (not particularly revelatory). However, the correspondance of certain other measurements to happiness may be of interest. While sorting by the other measurements, <b>generosity</b> has a noticable correlation with the overall happiness ranking. Does generosity lead to happiness, or does happiness lead to generosity? Or both? Nevertheless, it is clear that one of the many interesting pieces of data that I can walk away with is generosity's correlation to happiness.</p>

    <h2>Data Point 2: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#health">Health's Relation to Life Satisfaction</a></h2>
    <p>(Under the chart, click "Data", and you can download the CSV.)</p>
    <p>This chart gives an interesting perspective on the correlation between <b>health</b> and happiness. The countries surveyed on these two measurements show a direct correlation - that is, in general, the higher the life expectancy (health), the more likely people are to rate themselves as happy. This is a good motivator for keeping your body healthy, so that it may live to see old age. Healthy people get sick less often, generally have better moods, and can participate in physical activity, which is vital for one's mental health.</p>

    <h2>Data Point 3: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#income">The Relationship Between Income and Happiness</a></h2>
    <p>This graph is mostly numerical, showing the correlation between GDP per capita and self-reported happiness.</p>
    <p>Does money buy happiness? If we zoom out as far as possible (on a global scale), the evidence appears to be "yes." But it's important to specify what we're looking at. The countries rated at the top are not "filthy rich" - in fact, the countries that pass or approach the $100K threshold tend to be less happy than the countries that lag close behind. We're dealing in the broadest possible sense - extrapolating data from countries with hundreds of millions of citizens. The countries at the top of the list are those whose population can largely afford all of their basic needs. When understood in this way, we see money as a way to prevent unhappiness, rather than a way to gain happiness. In fact, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/14/money-can-buy-happiness-but-only-to-a-point.html">other studies</a> point to the conclusion that higher incomes provide diminshing returns at around $70K, when one can easily pay for all of his or her expenses. The message to take away from this is that money is a necessary, but not sufficient, determinant of happiness.</p>
